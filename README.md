# Interessant

Do I use the word 'interessant' often **idiosyncratically** when speaking or writing German? Or did someone infect me with it?!

### Running the code

First, export a WhatsApp chat and move it into the folder. The name of the file should be `_chat.txt`. Then run the following:

```bash
python3 process_chat_export.py
```

After this step, a file called `_chat.csv` is created.

You can play with the R script to learn more about your habit of saying 'interessant' in WhatsApp chats ðŸ˜‚
